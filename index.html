            Three months... Three months might just be "a couple of months," but it’s been a journey filled with memories, challenges, and so much love.<br><br>
            
            You say I’m stuck with you? Well, let me tell you, I couldn’t be happier to be “stuck” with the most amazing person I’ve ever met. If it’s a rule you made, then it’s a rule I’ll follow gladly, because I can’t imagine my life right now without you in it.
I’m just as guilty as you are for making these past months so beautiful.<br><br>
            
            I know the last two months have been challenging with the distance, but you’ve made me feel closer than ever despite it. And now, knowing that in just 48 hours I’ll finally be able to hold you in my arms, I can hardly wait.
Every day with you has been perfect, and I can only imagine how much better it will be when we’re together again.<br><br>
            
            
I’m trying to be patient for Thursday, but you know I’m already counting the minutes! 
Thank you for your love, for your patience, and for making these past three months the most amazing of my life.<br><br>
            
            I may not fully understand the depths of your love, but I promise to spend every day showing you just how much you mean to me. You’ve made my world brighter in every way, and I’m so incredibly grateful to be on this journey with you. Here's to many more months, and years, of love, laughter, and endless adventures together.<br><br>
            
            
With all my love.<br><br>
Bi <br><br>

Oh yeah, so Just you know, I have something for you, but you will have your hands on it maybe next week. Who knows...
